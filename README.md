Julia tutorials
Hi all welcome to Julia tutorials. I have been working on Julia from past 2 years and thought of creating a tutorial which will help anyone who wants to work on Data Science projects using Julia.

Contents of the tutorial:

1. [DataFrames](Julia/DataFrames in Julia.ipynb)


Data used:

1. [home_data](Julia/home_data.csv)
